      <h1 className="mt-5 mb-4">What are DevOps Projects?</h1>
      <p>
        DevOps (Development and Operations) is a software engineering approach
        that focuses on working with the development and operations team
        collectively to automate the project at each level. It ensures reliable
        outcomes from the software. The eight stages of DevOps include – Plan,
        Discover, Continuous Feedback, Observe, Operate, Deploy, Test, and
        Build.
      </p>
      <p>
        DevOps engineers work on some interesting and automated projects using
        DevOps techniques. These projects on DevOps give you a practical idea of
        its working.

        If you’re a newbie, looking forward to making a career in DevOps, here’s
        What to learn to become a DevOps engineer. which will pave the way to
        becoming a DevOps engineer.

        Before we move to the next part, you should have a deeper knowledge of
        DevOps concepts. You can consider enrolling yourself in GUVI’s DevOps
        Career Program, which lets you gain practical experience by developing
        real-world projects and covers technologies including Agile, Scrum,
        Linux, Git, Bash Scripting, Dockers, Containers, AWS infrastructure,
        etc.{" "}

        <p>
          If you’re a beginner thinking about which could be the best project
          idea on DevOps, you can start with building a web server using Docker.
          You must have a basic understanding of working with containers and how
          to use Docker to deploy and manage a web application. This project
          also lets you understand about monitoring your server and
          troubleshooting issues that arise at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          By building this project, you get a clear understanding of the basics
          of DevOps concepts. In this project, the client sends requests and the
          server responds to the queries of the client via the World Wide Web
          using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols, to
          communicate with the client and server.

        <p>
          The next best DevOps project idea is implementing a CI/CD pipeline. A
          continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is a set
          of procedures that one must follow to deploy a new software version.
          These pipelines are responsible for automating the software delivery
          process and making it faster and easier for new updates and features
          to be released.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to check on configuring and managing these pipelines for
          better functioning. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline helps accelerate
          application development and lifecycles, improves application stability
          and uptime, and builds quality into an automated build and release
          process.

        <h2>Creating a Chatbot</h2>

        <p>
          Another project idea of DevOps is creating a chatbot that could be
          used for customer support. This chatbot helps customers to solve
          queries and also helps in troubleshooting problems. It acts as a
          two-way communication channel for fetching desired information from
          systems
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use Amazon Lex which is a fully managed artificial
          intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models to
          design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces in
          applications. You need to be familiar with DevOps tools like AWS Lex,
          Hubot, Lita, and many more in order to build a feature-rich chatbot.
